## DOCKER
when  first running docker-compose up -d :
delete data folder
import the pastries.json file via mongodb-compass software

Need to down and up docker for every changes made.
When developping on backend or frontend, stop the container and run locally

## TODO
animation for when the player wins
--> Let the player see the dices and add fancy stuff

facilitate the winning
maybe add a numberOfPastriesWon in user and if chancesLeft = 1 && pastriesWon == 0

fix stuuf on choosePastries
